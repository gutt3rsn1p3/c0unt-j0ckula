# C0unt J0ckula

Printable LaTeX forms (and eventually supporting tools) for tracking workouts, for those of us who do cannot be trusted to wander off if tracking lifts digitally.

**NOTE:** This is a quick and dirty project intended to get me up and running (heh), it is not intended to be a polished product.

## Currently Usable Forms
* **Bimonthly progress calendar:** Make weekly goals, check off days, view monthly workout trends
* **Weekly Weigh-in:** Track weight at start/end of week, calculate deltas
* **Runners' Log:** Generic log for tracking basic run stats
* **Templated daily workout entries:** Interactive LaTeX-formatted daily workout planning. WIP Items
    * Automatic LaTeX compilation
    * Superset entries
    * Input redesign
    * Spacing needs some work

## To Dos:
* Static Forms
    * C25k progress log
    * Automated Calendar date generation
* Housekeeping
    * Clean up whitespace in templates and src (whoops)
    * Document script usage
* Planned Adjustments to Existing Templates
    * Better alignment of core exercises with rest of workouts
    * Move Barbell Shrug to Free Weights
    * Add lower back prehab to Back and Chest
